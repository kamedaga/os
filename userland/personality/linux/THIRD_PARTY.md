# LPR third-party code

`lpr-linux-x86_64.so` links the decoder-only subset of Zydis 4.1.1 and its
Zycore headers. The source revisions are pinned by
`pack/scripts/download_zydis.sh` and are used only to decode executable bytes
inside LPR at runtime. The imported Linux ELF is not modified or annotated at
build/import time.
